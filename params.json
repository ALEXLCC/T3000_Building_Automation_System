{"name":"T3000 building automation system","tagline":"","body":"T3000 Building Automation System\r\n================================\r\n\r\nThis is our T3000 Building Automation front end, a mature project for managing the air conditioning, lighting, access control and other automation functions of commercial buildings. The application runs on a Windows PC and allows the building operator to manage the building as a complete system. There is a small but growing team of developers working on the application full time. The system works mainly with Temco Controls products but integrators, controls contractors and other manufacturers are encouraged to join in to add their own devices and features. Communication to the various systems is over Ethernet, wifi, RS485, RS232, zigbee and GSM network. The protocols supported so far are Modbus RTU, Bacnet IP & MSTP.\r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about putting in effort into a project which suddenly goes dark or becomes closed source Temco has been around for a while, since 1969 actually. And we've never charged licence fees for our software since we started making building automation gear 25 years ago. Drop me an email and I'll hook you up with the developers.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/temcocontrols/T3000_Building_Automation_System/wiki) for details on how you can get started with contributing towards the project. \r\n\r\nRegards,   \r\nMaurice Duteau     \r\nGeneral Manager    \r\n[Temco Controls](http://www.temcocontrols.com/)    \r\nmaurice (at) temcocontrols (dot) com      \r\n\r\nSome of the screen shots of T3000 application as as follows:      \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_1](http://www.4shared.com/download/2HDba9or/1_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_2](http://www.4shared.com/download/NF9J9Kxq/2_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_3](http://www.4shared.com/download/lADm6SHp/3_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_4](http://www.4shared.com/download/ZQNKCZh4/4_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_5](http://www.4shared.com/download/HxPi2ZG-/5_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_6](http://www.4shared.com/download/e5UYnrBu/6_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_7](http://www.4shared.com/download/Zrxsrpt1/7_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_8](http://www.4shared.com/download/aDG0IXRz/8_online.jpg)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_9](http://www.4shared.com/download/pasE7n2F/9_online.jpg)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_10](http://www.4shared.com/download/BcT2Rq8l/10_online.jpg)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_11](http://www.4shared.com/download/vu8fHhq5/11_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_12](http://www.4shared.com/download/JtrqZSYn/12_online.bmp)     \r\n\r\n![T3000_screen_capture_13](http://www.4shared.com/download/kDjeOQpR/13_online.bmp)      \r\n\r\nHave a look at our website and products!!!     \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
